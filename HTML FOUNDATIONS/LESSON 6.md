COMMIT MESSAGES

Lesson Overview
 * How to write a meaningful commit message
 * Why meaningful commit messages are important
 * When to commit

Are commit messages so important they deserve their own lesson?
 - Yes!
  1. When applying for jobs, employers will look through projects on GitHub and they will look through your commit history. Having good commits as a novice developer will help you stand out
  2. Having a good commit message history will allow you to quickly see what changes were made and why
  3. Having a good commit message history will also be helpful if you come back to a project after stepping away from it for a while

Bad vs. good commits
 - When it comes to writing commits, it is crucial to know how to write them effectively
 - Bad commit message:
  - fix a bug
  - The message is too vague, leaving the other developers confused. A good commit message describes what problem your changes solve and hwo to fix them
 - Effective commits have two separate body parts: a subject, and a body

Subject
 - A brief summary to the change you made to the project
  - This is the change I made to the codebase
  - GITHUB HAS A 72-CHAR LIMIT

Body
 - A concise yet clear description
  - Describe the problem you commit solves and how
  - Fixing the commit message from earlier (fix a bug)
   - Adding missing link and alt text to the company's logo
   - Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information
 - This is a good commit because:
  - Provides a subject that specifies your code's actions
  - Contains a body that provides a concise yet clear description of why the commit was needed to be made
  - Separates the subject from the body with a new/blank line making it easier for other devs to read


When to commit
 - A good way to view a commit is like a 'snapshot' of your code at the moment that it was made
 - Practice commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code

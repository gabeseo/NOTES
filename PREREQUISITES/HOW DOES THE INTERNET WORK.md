How does the Internet work?

Summary:
 - The internet is the backbone of the web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible; a large network of computers which communicate all together
 - The internet began in the 60s as a US-army-funded research project, but then evolved to a public infrastructure by the 80s

A simple network:
 - When two computers need to communicate, you need to link them either through an ethernet cable or wirelessly through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
 - To connect a lot of computers together, you need a router: A small device that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer

A network of networks:
 - We are able to connect an infinite amount of computers together by connecting router to router
 - This is very close to what we call the internet today, but we are missing the network to connect to the rest of the world
 - We solve this issue by using a modem that turns the information from our network into information manageable by our telelphone infrastructure and vice versa
 - To send messages network to network, we need to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
 - An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISP's routers

Finding computers:
 - If you want to send a message to a computer, you need to specify which computer to send it to by finding the network the computer is linked through which has its own unique address called an IP (Internet Protocol) address
    - It is an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots (000.0.0.000)
    - Using a domain name is the easiest way for us to reach a computer over the internet

Internet and the web
 - The internet and the web are not the same thing
 - The internet is a technical infrastructure that allows countless computers to be connected together
 - Among these compupters, some computers can send messages intelligible to web browsers
 - TLDR the internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure

Intranets and Extranets
 - Intranets are private networks that are restricted to members of a particular organization
    - Used to provide a portal for members to securely access shared resources, collaborate, and communicate
 - Extranets are similar to intranets, except they open all or part of a private network to allow sharing and collaboration with other organizations
    - Typically used to safely and securely share information with clients, suppliers, collaborators, customers, etc.
 - Both the intranet and extranets run on the same kind of infrastructure as the Internet, and use the same protocols

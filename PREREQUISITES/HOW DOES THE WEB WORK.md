Comparison between a public library and the library within a web server:

 - Public Library:
    1. Find a search index and look for the title of the book
    2. Make a note of the catalog number of the book
    3. Go to the particular section containing the book, find the right catalog number, and get the book

 - Web server comparison:
    1. The library is like a web server. It has several sections, which is similar to a web server hosting multiple websites
    2. The different sections (math, history, etc.) in the library are like websites. Each section is like a unique website, where two sections do not contain the same books
    3. The books in each section are like webpages. Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL)
    4. The search index is like the search engine. Each book has its own unique location in the library which is specified by the catalog number

Web page:
 - A web page can embed a variety of different resources such as:
    1. style information: Controlling a page's look and feel
    2. scripts: Which add interactivity to the page
    3. media: Images, sounds, and videos

Website:
 - A website is a collection of linked web pages that share a unique domain name

Web server:
 - A web server is a computer that is hosting one or more websites
